## What is git?
Git as a time machine for your code. It keeps track of every change you make to your files, so if you ever mess something up or want to go back to an earlier version, you can do it easily. It also helps you collaborate with others on the same code without stepping on each other's toes. So, in short, Git helps you manage your code's history and work together with others smoothly.


1. Installing Git:
    • First, you need to install Git on your computer. You can download it from the official website (https://git-scm.com/), and the installation process is usually 
    straightforward.
